# retro-pop-grid

1970s retro pop art with strict Swiss international grid, thick black outlines, and flat color blocks.

## Color Palette

- Background: Warm vintage cream/beige (#F5F0E6)
- Flat accents: Salmon pink, sky blue, mustard yellow, mint green—all muted retro tones
- Contrast blocks: Solid pure black (#000000) and solid pure white (#FFFFFF) used strategically for extreme contrast
- Line art and outlines: Solid thick black

## Visual Elements

- Uniform thick black outlines on all illustrations, text boxes, and grid dividers
- Pure 2D flat vector aesthetic with subtle screen print texture
- Strict Swiss international grid: poster divided into square and rectangular cells by thick black lines
- Black-background cells with white text for warnings or key categories (inverted contrast)
- Geometric fill patterns in empty cells: checkerboards, diagonal lines, dots
- Flat abstract symbols, warning signs, keyholes, stars, arrows
- Vintage comic-style smiley/frowny faces for quality indicators
- Colored cells used for breathing room—some with minimal/no content

## Typography

- Headers: Bold brutalist or retro thick display fonts, high legibility
- Body: Clean sans-serif, structured typographic alignment
- Decorative English text acceptable for stylistic labels ("WARNING", "INFO", "BEST")
- All content text in specified language

## Style Enforcement

- Absolutely no gradients, shading, drop shadows, or 3D effects
- Everything anchored in grid cells—no floating or unorganized elements
- Maintain 1970s retro pop art and underground comic illustration feel
- Visual density balanced with rhythmic grid—some cells intentionally sparse for contrast

## Avoid

- 3D rendering, realistic details, gradients, soft shadows
- Soft, thin, or sketch-like pencil lines
- Free-flowing, unorganized, or floating layouts (everything must be grid-anchored)
- Pure white background canvas
- Organic or hand-drawn imperfections
