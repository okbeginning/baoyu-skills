# pop-laboratory

Lab manual precision meets pop art color impact—coordinate systems, technical diagrams, and fluorescent accents on blueprint grid.

## Color Palette

- Background: Professional grayish-white with faint blueprint grid texture (#F2F2F2)
- Primary: Muted teal/sage green (#B8D8BE) for major functional blocks and data zones
- High-alert accent: Vibrant fluorescent pink (#E91E63) strictly for warnings, critical data, or "winner" highlights
- Marker highlights: Vivid lemon yellow (#FFF200) as translucent highlighter effect for keywords
- Line art: Ultra-fine charcoal brown (#2D2926) for technical grids, coordinates, and hairlines

## Visual Elements

- Coordinate-style labels on every module (e.g., R-20, G-02, SEC-08)
- Technical diagrams: exploded views, cross-sections with anchor points, architectural skeletal lines
- Vertical/horizontal rulers with precise markers (0.5mm, 1.8mm, 45°)
- "Marker-over-print" effect: color blocks slightly offset from text, postmodern print feel
- Cross-hair targets, mathematical symbols (Σ, Δ, ∞), directional arrows (X/Y axis)
- Microscopic detail annotations alongside macroscopic bold headers
- Corner metadata: tiny barcodes, timestamps, technical parameters
- High contrast between massive bold headers and tiny 8pt-style annotations

## Typography

- Headers: Bold brutalist characters, high visual impact
- Body: Professional sans-serif or crisp technical print
- Numbers: Large, highlighted with yellow or blue to stand out
- Annotations: Ultra-crisp, small technical labels

## Style Enforcement

- Strictly systematic color usage: only teal, pink, yellow, charcoal—no rainbow palette
- Sufficient fine grid lines and coordinate annotations throughout
- Maintain tension between large impactful headers and small precise parameters
- Lab manual aesthetic: mix of microscopic details and macroscopic data

## Avoid

- Cute or cartoonish doodles
- Soft pastels or generic textures
- Empty white space
- Flat vector stock icons
- Organic or hand-drawn imperfections

## Best For

Technical product guides, specification comparisons, precision-focused data visualization, engineering-adjacent content
